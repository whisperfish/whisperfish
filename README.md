# Whisperfish

Whisperfish is a native [Signal](https://www.whispersystems.org/) client
for [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/). The user interface is
heavily based on the jolla-messages application written by Jolla Ltd.

Whisperfish has plenty of features these days and is in a mostly usable state.
Join our development channel on Matrix
([#whisperfish:rubdos.be](https://matrix.to/#/#whisperfish:rubdos.be))
or Libera.Chat (#whisperfish) to get in touch, and check
[our wiki](https://gitlab.com/whisperfish/whisperfish/-/wikis/home) to see
whether Whisperfish would work for you.

To install, you have two options:

- Releases from [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/rubdos/whisperfish)
- "Nightly" builds from
  [the Gitlab Package Registry](https://gitlab.com/whisperfish/whisperfish/-/packages).

In most cases, there should be no need to install from Git directly.
We push regular updates to OpenRepos, when they make sense.

Please mind that Whisperfish in still in *beta condition*, which means
that certain things do not work, other things make the application
crash, and I've heard reports that beta software can be a cause for
dogs eating homework. You've been warned. On the other hand, we have
many people happily using Whisperfish as daily driver, and we make up
for lacking features in our community support in the aforementioned
Matrix and IRC room. Please come say hello! We don't bite (we may
byte), and we don't eat homework.

## Project Status

This project started from a now outdated Go-based SailfishOS client for
Signal. This version, 0.6 and onwards, is a complete rewrite, and uses
[libsignal-client](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client)
instead. This means we aim for better maintainability. It also means the
whole SailfishOS app had to be rewritten, and you may want to make a
back-up of your current files if you still come from 0.5. Specifically:

- `.local/share/harbour-whisperfish` contains all your data.
- `.config/harbour-whisperfish` contains the apps configuration.

In current releases the paths have changed:

- `.local/share/be.rubdos/harbour-whisperfish`
- `.config/be.rubdos/harbour-whisperfish`

## Performance Tips

Whisperfish connects to Signal using Websockets. For a better user
experience try adjusting the power settings on your Jolla to disable
late suspend. This should keep the network interfaces up and allow
Whisperfish to maintain websocket connections even when the device is in
"sleep". This could potentially impact your battery life depending on
your usage. Otherwise every time your device goes into deep sleep, the
Websocket connection is broken and you may not receive messages until
the next time the OS wakes up and Whisperfish reconnects.

To disable late suspend and enable "early suspend" run:

    mcetool --set-suspend-policy=early

## Building from source

Whisperfish is written in Rust (and QML), and Rust is a bit of a special
entity in Sailfish OS. Luckily, Jolla has provided a more or less decent
Rust compiler since Sailfish OS 3.4, but it had some issues, which were
[https://github.com/sailfishos/rust/pull/14](fixed) only in Sailfish OS
4.5. Using the corresponding Sailfish SDK 3.10.4 is practically a requirement.
Older versions may still work, but are not supported. Using an older
version should not be needed, since the binary works all the way
down to Sailfish OS 3.4 (at least).

**Note:** Only the Docker build engine supports Rust compiling. VirtualBox build engine will not work.

Since early January 2024, building Whisperfish (again) requires installing
Rust (and its dependencies) from Ruben's repository. This is needed until
the Sailfish SDK Jolla releases provides Rust 1.75.0 - at the time of writing
the version is 1.52 (with 1.61 upstreamed).

Please see [Rust 1.75 build instructions](doc/rust-1.75.md) for details.

Once you have the SDK up and running and the Whisperfish sources fetched,
it compiles just like any other native Sailfish OS application.

Set the build target 4.5.0.18 and architecture of your choice (builds for
target 4.5.0.18 should also work for a few Sailfish OS versions back, too):

    sfdk config target=SailfishOS-4.5.0.18-aarch64 build

Then just build it:

    sfdk build

If you want to also build the sharing plugin for SFOS 4.3+, use this command (note the double double dashes):

    sfdk build -- --with shareplugin_v2

For Sailfish 4.2 and older, use `--with shareplugin_v1` instead.

Because of a bug in `sb2`, it is currently not possible to (reliably) build Whisperfish (or any other Rust project) using more than a single thread. This means your compilation is going to take a while, especially the first time. Get yourself some coffee!

However, subsequent compilations (i.e. only Whisperfish code has been changed) tend to build fine with modest threading. This seems to work rather well with `sfdk` at least. You can take advantage of this by defining a `taskset` macro that expands to the [taskset](https://linux.die.net/man/1/taskset) command you want to prefix `cargo build` with. It also removes `-j 1` single-thread parameter:

    sfdk build -- --define "taskset 0x55"

If you get errors (command not found or status 126) at linking stage, make sure that you are not using `~/.cargo/config` to override linkers or compilers.

### Voice and video calls

For voice and video calling, Whisperfish requires the RingRTC library,
including Signal's custom WebRTC implementation.  You can download pre-built artifacts with the following command:

    bash fetch-webrtc.sh

See <https://www.rubdos.be/2024/09/08/building-ringrtc-for-whisperfish.html> for how to build these artifacts.

To build Whisperfish with support for voice and video calls included, use

    sfdk build -- --with calling

This triggers the `cargo build --feature calling` feature flag, which adds voice and video support.

### Building for the host

Building Whisperfish on your host machine is also possible. This is useful for development and debugging purposes. There are some differences to be aware of.

The RPM automatically selects the `sailfish` feature flag, which will not compile outside of SailfishOS.  This feature flag is *not* enabled by default, so it doesn't sit in the way.

You'll have to manually set the `OUTPUT_DIR` variable, which contains the output of the `webrtc` build.  The `fetch-webrtc.sh` script fetches `libwebrtc.a` pre-built for all four architectures, and for the two major versions of OpenSSL (3.x, and 1.1.1).

    bash fetch-webrtc.sh
    OUTPUT_DIR=$PWD/ringrtc/322/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/ cargo build --features bundled-sqlcipher

You can swap out `322` for `111` if your system uses OpenSSL 1.1.1.

## Database

Whisperfish uses SQLCipher to store its data. SQLCipher is essentially SQLite with encryption features.
Entering a password when registering Whisperfish makes the database encrypted,
without password it's just a plain SQLite database.

During development it's often handy to have a database or schema at hand.
If you don't want to mess with your Whisperfish database, or even a copy of it,
you can create a plain SQLite database with `create-database.sh`.

## i18n Translations (help wanted)

Whisperfish supports i18n translations and uses
[Text ID Based Translations](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-id-based-i18n.html).
